<td>This book only gives you <b>the first steps to programming</b>. It covers very basic skills that you must develop for years, to reach a high enough level and start working as a programmer.</td>
</tr></table>

The book is also used as an unofficial **textbook for school-level programming courses in the high schools**, studying professions like "**Programmer**", "**Application Programmer**" and "**System Programmer**".

## Who is This Book Intended for?

This book is suitable for **complete beginners in programming**, who want to try what programming is and learn the main constructions for writing programming code that is used in software development, regardless of programming languages and technologies used. The book provides a **solid basis** of practical skills that are used for further study in programming and software development.

## Why Did We Choose The Python Language?

For this book, we chose **Python**, because it is a **modern** language for high-level programming and at the same time it is easy to learn and suitable for **beginners**. As a use **Python** is **widespread**, with a well-developed ecosystem, numerous libraries, and technological frameworks, and therefore gives many **prospects** for development. **Python** combines the paradigms of procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming in a modern way with easy-to-use syntax. In the book, we'll use the **Python language** and the **PyCharm** development environment, which is available for free from JetBrains.

As we will explain later, **the programming language with which we start is not essential**, but we still need to use some programming language, and in this book, we have chosen **Python**.  The book can also be found mirrored in other programming languages such as C# and JavaScript (see [https://csharp-book.softuni.org](https://csharp-book.softuni.org)).

## The Book in Other Programming Languages: Java, JavaScript, C#, C++

This programming book for complete beginners is available in several programming languages (or is in the process of being adapted for them):
* [Programming Basics with Java (English)](https://java-book.softuni.org)

If you prefer a different language, choose from the list above.

## Programming is Learned by a Lot of Writing, Not Reading!

If anyone thinks they're going to read a book and learn to program without writing a code and solve tasks hard, they're delusional. Programming is learned with **many, many practices**, with writing code every day and solving hundreds, even thousands of tasks, seriously and with perseverance, for years.

You need to **solve a lot of problems**, to make mistakes, to fix them, search for solutions and information on the Internet, to try, to experiment, to find better solutions, get used to the code, syntax, programming language, development environment, error search and debugging of non-working code, task reasoning, algorithmic thinking, breaking down problems in steps and implementing every step, gaining experience and improving your skills every day, because learning to write code is just **the first step towards the profession of a software engineer**. You have a lot to learn!

We advise the reader, as a minimum, **to try all the examples from the book**, to interact with them, to change and test them. Even more important than the examples **are the exercises** because they develop the practical skills of a developer.

**Solve all the tasks in the book**, because programming is learned by practice! The tasks after each topic are carefully selected to cover in-depth the included learning
material. The purpose of solving all tasks from all the topics covered is to give **complete writing skills to a program code** at the beginners level (as is the purpose of this book).

<!-- to update -->
<!-- ### Free Programming Courses at SoftUni

SoftUni organizes **free programming courses for beginners**: online and on-site in a few locations. The purpose is to give a chance to **everyone interested** in programming and technologies to **try programming**, check if they are interested and if they would get seriously involved in software development. You can sign up for the free course in **programming basics** using the SoftUni application page: [https://softuni.org](https://softuni.org).

The free programming basics courses at SoftUni aim to introduce you to **basic programming constructions** in the software development world, that you can use in any programming language. These include working with **data**, **variables**, and **expressions**, using **conditional statements**, constructing **loops**, defining and calling **methods**, and other approaches for building programming logic. The trainings are **highly practically oriented**, which means that **the emphasis is strongly on exercises**, and you get the opportunity to apply your knowledge during the learning process.

This **programming book** accompanies the free programming lessons for beginners at SoftUni and serves as an additional teaching aid to help the learning process. -->

### Judge System for Exercise Verification

**The SoftUni Judge system** ([https://judge.softuni.org](https://judge.softuni.org)) is an automated Internet system for **checking the solutions of programming exercises via a series of tests**. The submission and verification happen in **real-time**: you submit the solution, and within seconds you get an answer whether it is correct. Each **successfully** taken test gives you the points it gains. For a completely correct solution, you get all the points for this problem. For a partially correct solution, you get part of the points for the problem. For a completely wrong solution, you get 0 points.

This how the **SoftUni Judge** looks like:![](/assets/chapter-1-images/02.Expression-03.png)

**All problems from the current book are available for testing in SoftUni judge**, and we strongly recommend testing them after you solve them to be sure you don't miss anything and that your solution works correctly according to the problem requirements.

Keep in mind some **specifics about SoftUni judge**:
* For each problem, the **judge system keeps the best score you had**. Therefore, if you upload a solution with the wrong code or a lower score compared to the previous one, the system won't take away your points.
* The output of your program is **compared** by the system to a strictly expected result. Every **unnecessary symbol, missing comma, or space** may lead to 0 points on a particular test. The **output** that the judge expects is **described in the requirements of every problem** and **nothing else should be added**. 

**Example:** If the output requires printing a number (e.g. `25`), do not display any descriptive messages such as `The result is: 25`. Print the output as it is required, i.e., only the number.

The SoftUni judge system is **available any time** via its website: [https://judge.softuni.org](https://judge.softuni.org).
 - Use of the system is **free of charge**.

We are convinced that after a few submitted problems, **you will like to receive instant feedback** for your solutions, and the Judge system will become your favorite assistant in learning programming.

## How to Become a Software Developer?

Dear readers, many of you must have the ambition to become programmers, make a living with software development, or work in the IT sector. That is why we have prepared for you a **short guide "How to become a programmer"** to navigate you on the steps to this much-desired profession.

Becoming a programmer (at the level of starting work in a software company) would take **at least 1-2 years of learning and writing code every day**, solving several thousand programming tasks, developing several practical projects, and gaining a lot of experience with code writing and software development. It's not possible for a month or two! The profession of software engineering requires a large amount of knowledge, backed by extensive practice. 

There are **4 main skill groups** that all programmers must have. Most of these skills are preserved over time and are not significantly affected by the development of specific technologies (which change constantly). These are the skills that **every good programmer has** and which every rookie should aspire to obtain:
* code writing (20%)
* algorithmic thinking (30%)
* fundamental knowledge of the profession (25%)
* languages and development technologies (25%)

### Skill # 1 - Coding (20%)

Learning how **to write code** forms about 20% of the minimum skills required for a programmer to start work in a software company. The ability to code includes the following components:
* work with variables, conditionals, loops
* functions, methods, classes, and objects 
* work with data: arrays, hash tables, strings

The ability to code **can be learned in a few months** of intensive studying and solving practical tasks by writing code every day. This book covers only the first part of the coding skill: **working with variables, conditionals, and loops**. The rest remains to be learned in subsequent trainings, courses, and books.

The book give only the beginning of a long-term and serious study, on the path to professional programming. You won't be able to become a programmer without mastering the material from this book. You will lack programming fundamentals and it will become increasingly difficult to move forward. Therefore **pay enough attention to the basics of programming**: solve problems and write a lot of code for months until you learn **to easily solve all the problems in this book**. Then move on.

We pay special attention to the fact that **programming language doesn't have significant relevance** for one's coding skill. You can either code or not. If you can code in C#, then you'll easily switch to Java or C++, or any other language. These are the skills that each programming book for beginners starts with, including this one.

### Skill # 2 - Algorithmic Thinking (30%) 

Algorithmic (logical, engineering, mathematical, abstract) thinking forms about 30% of the minimum skills for a start in the profession. **Algorithmic thinking** is the ability to break a task into a logical sequence of steps (algorithm) and to find a solution for each step, then to put them together in a working solution for the initial task. This is the most important skill that the programmer has.

How **to build algorithmic thinking**?
* Algorithms for thinking are developed by reviewing **many (1000+) programming tasks**, using the most diverse of them. This is the recipe: reducing thousands of practical tasks, inventing an algorithm for them, and executing the algorithm, along with debugging errors along the way.
* Physics, mathematics, and/or similar sciences help, but they are not restraining! People with **engineering and technical inclinations** usually learn to think logically easily, because they already have the skills for solving problems, although not algorithmic. 
* The ability **to solve programming tasks** (which requires algorithmic thinking) is extremely important for programmers. Many companies require only this skill in job interviews.

This book develops **a beginner's level of algorithmic thinking**, but it is not enough to make a good programmer. To become proficient in the professions, you will need to add **logical thinking skills and improve tasks** outside this book, such as **working with data structures** (arrays, lists, matrices, hash tables, tree structures) and basic **algorithms** (search, sorting, tree structures, recursion, etc.). 

As you may guess, **the programing language does not matter** for the development of algorithmic thinking. To think logically is universal, even if it's not related only to programming. Precisely because of the well-developed logical thinking, it is considered that **developers are quite smart** and that a simple-minded person could not be a developer.

### Skill #3 – Fundamental Knowledge of The Profession (25%) 

**Fundamental knowledge and skills** for programming, software development, software engineering and computer science form about 25% of the developer's minimum start-up skills. Here are the most important parts of these skills and knowledge: 
* **basic mathematical concepts** related to programming: coordinate systems, vectors and matrices, discrete and indiscreet mathematical functions, end machines and state machines, concepts of combination and statistics, algorithm complexity, mathematical modeling, and others. 
* **skills to program** - code writing, data work, use of conditional structures and loops, work with arrays, lists and associative arrays, strings, and word processing, working with streams and files, using program interfaces (APIs), working with a debugger, and others.
* **data structures and algorithms** - lists, trees, hash tables, columns, search, sorting, recursive, tree crawling, etc.
* **object-oriented programming** (OOP) – working with classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, interfaces, data encapsulation, exception management, design templates.
* **functional programming** (FP) - working with lambda functions, high order functions, functions that return a function as a result, closing a state in a function (closure), and more.
* **databases** - relational and non-relational databases, database modeling (tables and links between them), SQL query language, object-relational data access (ORM) technologies, transactionality, and transaction management.
* **network programming** - network protocols, network communication, TCP/IP, concepts, tools, and technologies from computer networks.
* **client-server** interaction, communication between systems, back-end technologies, front-end technologies, MVC architectures.
* **back-end development technologies** - web server architecture, HTTP protocol, MVC architecture, REST architecture, web development frameworks, templating engines.
* **web front-end technologies (client development)** - HTML, CSS, JS, HTTP, DOM, AJAX, back-end communication, REST API call, front-end frameworks, basic design and UX (user experience) concepts.
* **mobile technologies** - mobile applications, Android and iOS development, mobile user interface (UI), server logic call.
* **built-in systems** - microcontrollers, digital and analog input and output control, sensor access, peripheral control.
* **operating systems** - work with operating systems (Linux, Windows, etc.), installation, configuration and basic system administration, process handling, memory, file system, users, multitasking, virtualization, and containers.
* **parallel programming and asynchronousness** - thread management, asynchronous tasks, promises, common resources, and access synchronization.
* **software engineering** - source control systems, development management, task planning and management, software development methodologies, software requirements and prototypes, software design, software architectures, software documentation.
* **software testing** - unit testing, test-driven development, QA engineering, error reporting and error trackers, test automation, building processes, and continuous integration.

We must make it clear another time that **the programming language is irrelevant** to the uptake of all these skills. They accumulate slowly, over many years of practice in the profession. Some knowledge is fundamental and can be learned theoretically, but it takes years of practice to fully understand them in depth.

Fundamental knowledge and skills for programming, software development, software engineering, and computer science are taught during the **Software Engineering Program**, as well as several elective courses. Working with a variety of software libraries, APIs, frameworks, and software technologies and their interaction gradually builds this knowledge and skills, so do not expect that you will understand them from a single course, book or project.

Only **initial knowledge in the areas listed above** is usually sufficient to start working as a programmer, and acquiring more in-depth knowledge takes place at the workplace according to the technologies and development tools used by the given company and team.

### Skill #4 - Programming Languages and Software Technologies (25%) 

**Programming languages and software development technologies** form about 25% of the developer's minimum skills. They are the most voluminous to learn, but they change most quickly over time. If we look at **job advertisements** from the software industry, there are often all sorts of words mentioned (such as those listed below), but in fact, the ads silently **imply the first three skills**: to code, to think algorithmically, and to be proficient at the foundation of computer science and software engineering.

For these purely technological skills, the **programming language is relevant**.
* **Note**: only for this 25% of the profession does programming language matter!
* **For the remaining 75% of skills, language does not matter** and these skills are time-resilient and transferable between different languages and technologies.

Here are some commonly used software development stacks sought by software companies (up-to-date as of January 2018):
* **JavaScript** (JS) + CMO + PH + databases + MongoDB or MySQL + HTTP + web programming + HTML + CSS + DOM + jQuery + Node.js + Express + Angular or React
* **C#** + CMO + P + classes from .NET + DATABASE SQL Server + Entity Framework (EF) + ASP.NET MVC + HTTP + HTML + CSS + JS + DOM + jQuéry 
* **Java** + Java API classes + CMO + AP + databases + MySQL + HTTP + web programming + HTML + CSS + JS + DOM + jQuery + JSP/Servlets + Spring MVC or Java EE / JSF
* **PHP** + CMO + databases + MySQL + HTTP + web programming + HTML + CSS + JS + DOM + jQuery + Laravel / Symfony / other MVC framework for PHP 
* **Python** + CMO + PH + databases + MongoDB or MySQL + HTTP + web programming + HTML + CSS + JS + DOM + jQuery + Django
* **C++** + CMO + STL + Boost + native development + databases + HTTP + other languages 
* **Swift** + MacOS + iOS + Cocoa + Cocoa Touch + XCode + HTTP + REST + other languages

If the words listed above seem scary and incomprehensible to you, then you are quite at the beginning of your career and have **years to learn** until you reach the profession of a **software engineer**. Don't worry, every programmer goes through one or more technological stacks and has to study a **set of interconnected technologies**, but at the heart of it all is the **ability to write programming logic (coding)** that develops in this book, and the **ability to think algorithmically** (to solve programming tasks). You can not do without them!

### Programming Language Doesn't Matter!

As already made clear, **the difference between programming languages**, and more precisely between the skills of programmers in different languages and technologies, is in about **10-20% of skills**.
* All programmers have about **80-90% of the same skills**, which do not depend on language! These are the skills to program and develop software, and they are very similar in different programming languages and development technologies.
* The more languages and technologies you are proficient in, the faster you will learn new languages and the less you will feel a difference between them.

Indeed, **the programming language is almost irrelevant**, you just need to learn to program, and this starts with **coding** (this book), continues in the more complex **concepts of programming** (such as data structures, algorithms, OOP, and FP), and involves the uptake of **fundamental knowledge and skills for software development, software engineering, and computer science**.

Finally, when you take on specific technologies in a software project, only then will you need a **specific programming language**, knowledge of specific program libraries (APIs), frameworks, and software technologies (front-end UI technologies, back-end technologies, ORM technologies, etc.). Relax, you will learn them, all programmers learn them, but first, they learn the foundation: **to code and to do it well**.


This book uses the **Python** language, but it is not essential and can be replaced by Java, C#, JavaScript, PHP, C++, Ruby, Swift, Go, Kotlin, or any other language. To master **the profession of "software developer"** it is necessary to learn **to code** (20%), learn to **think algorithmically** and **solve problems** (30%), have a **fundamental knowledge of programming and computer science** (25%) and know a **specific programming language and the technologies relevant to it** (25%). Be patient, for a year or two, all this can be achieved at a good starting level, as long as you are serious and diligent.

## The History Behind This Book

The main engine and project manager for the creation of the current **free programming book for beginners** with open source is **[Svetlin Nakov, PhD](https://nakov.com)**.

In 2014, the SoftUni initiative was launched. In the beginning, it had a wider reach and included more theory, but in 2016 Svetlin Nakov, PhD completely revised them, renovated, simplified, and **directed them to be more practical**. This is how the **learning content core of this book was created**.

SoftUni's free programming start-up trainings are probably the largest ever conducted in Bulgaria. On the principle of free software and free knowledge, Svetlin Nakov led a **team of volunteers** and started this open-source project, initially to create a book based on programming with the C# language and later with other programming languages.
